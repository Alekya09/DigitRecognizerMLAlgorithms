# DigitRecognizerMLAlgorithms
Digit Recognizer using MNIST Data and ML Algorithms - CNN, MLP and SVM

RUN instructions :
clone the git repository : https://github.com/Alekya09/DigitRecognizerMLAlgorithms.git
To run the GUI which will load the pre-built Machine Learning Model follow the below instructions :
1. Open the file gui.py in a Python IDE
2. Install the package depenencies. It is suggested to run the file in Anaconda Interpreter Environment
3. Once dependecies are built, run the python file
The following Tab will open. Draw the digit and press button Recognize Digit
